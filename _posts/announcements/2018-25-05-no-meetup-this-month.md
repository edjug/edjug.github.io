# No meetup this month

Due to reason we there won't be a meetup in May, but do not despair, to make up for it we will be having a extra super special meetup in June when we'll be joined by JCP Chair Heather VanCura.

More details to follow, but be aware that for the June meetup we'll be moving from our usual last-Wednesday-of-the-month slot to Monday the 25th.
