After our snow aborted February we're kicking 2018 off to a cracking start with a talk from Marcus Biel entitled

> "A craftman's guide to designing clean architecture"

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - but if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-march-meetup-tickets-44400897279) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
