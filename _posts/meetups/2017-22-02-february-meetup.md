## Android Security - a tour from boot 

For our first talk of 2017 we're very lucky to have Ed Austin talk on Android security.

Based on his upcoming book Ed will provide a tour of the Android security model, starting from the moment the power is turned on through to how the model is enforced.

No prior knowledge is assumed, but Ed will cover a lot of details that are not easy to find out about elsewhere.

As always the talk is free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - if you're planning to come we ask that you get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-android-security-tickets-31594476931) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
