Since reasons got in the way of last months meetup, we're having a super special one this month.

Why is it super special? It is super special for three super special awesome reasons.

## 1. It's not on a Wednesday

Mondays are usually awful, so we've decided to make one of them better by making it an EdJug meetup day.

## 2. We've got the Java Community Process Chair visiting

That's right, we've got [Heather VanCura](https://heathervcblog.wordpress.com/) coming to see us. 

## 3. We're trying out a new ticket site

As if all that wasn't exciting enough, this month you get to click for free tickets on a [completely different website](https://ti.to/edjug/edjug-june-meetup).

The website is the only thing that's changed though. The tickets are still free, and as always the talks start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - but if you're planning to come please do get that [free ticket](https://ti.to/edjug/edjug-june-meetup) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
