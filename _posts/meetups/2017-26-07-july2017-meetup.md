We have two talks again this month. Bart Maraszek joins us again with a 2nd attempt at presenting

> *"Most developers agree that this is the best way to remove compile-time dependencies"* 

May the projector gods smile kindly upon him this time.

We're also very pleased to be joined by Craig Russell who will be talking about unit testing, test doubles and Mockito as viewed through the eyes of a mobile developer.

If there's time (or the projector gods frown on Bart again) we'll throw in some more [lean coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) into the mix as well.

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-july-meetup-tickets-36106301921) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
