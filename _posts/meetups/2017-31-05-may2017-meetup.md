This month we have Seb Rose, compulsive conference speaker and co-author of the Cucumber JVM book, presenting his whimsically entitled talk :- 

> *"As a Java developer, I want more language features, so that I can write better programs - whatever happened to Java in a nutshell?"* 

We are promised audience interaction - so please bring a laptop.

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-may-meetup-tickets-34535915854) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
