The organisers of [vjug24](https://virtualjug.com/vjug24/) had the good sense to ensure that it occurred on the same day as one of our meetups, so this month we'll be running an extra special super long session with t-shirts (we think).

We're one of the officially participating JUGs, so in additional to our usual pizza and drinks we've been promised vjug24 swag.

The session will kick off at 7 as usual at the [NCR offices at Kittle Yards](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@55.935442,-3.1801779,20z), but will run on until 10.

Everyone one is welcome to come along, but if you plan to come please grab a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/vjug24-java-user-group-special-tickets-37645109536) so we can plan for numbers.

No ticket == non pizza.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.

We're also pleased to announce that Bart will not be speaking at this event.
