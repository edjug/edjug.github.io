This month we have not one, but two talks.

## The container ecosystem

Kevin Cross will give a brief tour of the current state of the landscape that has evolved around containers and docker.

## CompletableFutures - Composable asynchronous programming

Dan Kift will look at the CompletableFuture interface introduced in Java 1.8

As always the talk are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - if you're planning to come we ask that you get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-android-security-tickets-31594476931) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
