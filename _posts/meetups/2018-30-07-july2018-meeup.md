Since last months this-isn't-a-wednesday meetup was so much fun, we're having another one on a Monday.

We'll be joined by [Pratik Patel](https://twitter.com/prpatel?lang=en) who'll be talking about *Serverless Architecture in the Java Ecosystem*. 

> In this session, we'll start with a short introduction to Serverless and what it means to developers, and why it's important to understand this technology. Then we'll survey Serverless options on the Java ecosystem to give you an idea of what is currently available. We'll do some coding and demos to give you a better idea of what all this Serverless stuff look like!

As always anyone is welcome to attend, but if you do plan to come please get a [free ticket](https://ti.to/edjug/edjug-july-meetup) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
