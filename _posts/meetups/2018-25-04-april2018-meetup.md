Slightly delayed for two months by snow, Keir will finally be presenting "Scala - more than a better Java".

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - but if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-april-meetup-tickets-45233886773) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
