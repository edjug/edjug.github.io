Assuming Java 9 is released into the wild as planned on the 21st we'll be celebrating the moment (a mere 6 days late) with an evening of Java 9 talks.

If the release is delayed yet again we'll be celebrating prematurely in full confidence that it will be out any day now.

So join us for

> "The Java 9 Module System: Why it's awesome and why you still won't use it"

And other talks TBC.

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - but if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-september-meetup-tickets-37869200799) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
