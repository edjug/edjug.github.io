This month we have a visitor.

Nikhil Nanivadekar is flying all the way from the USA to deliver unto us his JavaOne talk

> Collections.compare(JDK, Eclipse, Guava, Apache...) 

But that is not all. 

We were worried that Nikhil would be lonely, so we've also arranged for another JavaOne speaker, our very own Maurice Naftalin, to kick things off with a short talk entitled.

> What's up with Java?

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - but if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-november-meetup-tickets-39448854586) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.

We are also pleased to announce that Bart will not be speaking this month.
