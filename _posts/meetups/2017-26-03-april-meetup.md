## Property based testing 

Henry Coles will discuss an alternate approach to testing that is popular in functional languages and look at how it can be applied in Java.

As always the talk are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - if you're planning to come we ask that you get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-april-meetup-tickets-33846563984) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
