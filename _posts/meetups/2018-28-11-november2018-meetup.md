For our last meetup of 2018 Shehzad Nagi will talking about Openshift and Microservices from a developer's perspective in a talk appropriately entitled "Openshift and Microservices: a developer's perspective".

He'll cover the key differences between k8s and Openshift, how to use it and work through a use case deploying a microservice application through various stages of project life cycle.

As usual we'll also have a whole lot of pizza and fun.

As always anyone is welcome to attend, but if you do plan to come please get a [free ticket](https://ti.to/edjug/november-2018-meetup) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
