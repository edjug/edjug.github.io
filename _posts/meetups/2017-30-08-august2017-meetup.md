I'm sure everyone will be as pleased as I am that Bart will not be talking this month.

Instead we have a talks from Rob Mason on Selenium and Java 9 from Chris Stafford.

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - but if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-august-meetup-tickets-36779705088) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.
