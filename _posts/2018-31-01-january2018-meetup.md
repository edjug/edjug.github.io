For the first meetup of 2018 we have T-Shirts, stickers and a talk on Kotlin from Ed Austin.

As always the talks are free and will start at 7 at the NCR offices at Kittle Yards.

Anyone is welcome to attend - but if you're planning to come please get a [free ticket from EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/edjug-january-meetup-tickets-41943738852) so we can judge numbers for food and drinks.

If you have any special dietary requirements please get in touch and we'll try to accommodate them.

We are also pleased to announce that Bart will not be speaking this month.
